`libraryPath` {string}

This property stores the path which is used by `page.injectJs` function to resolve the script name.

Initially it is set to the location of the script invoked by PhantomJS.

## Examples

```javascript
var webPage = require('webpage');
var page = webPage.create();
// @TODO: Finish page.libraryPath example.
```
