`system.args` {String[]}

Queries and returns a list of the command-line arguments.  The first one is always the script name, which is then followed by the subsequent arguments.

& character might not be allowed in arguments. If an argument is passed in commandline with & character in it, its not returned in system.args.

## Examples

The following example prints all of the command-line arguments:

```javascript
var system = require('system');
var args = system.args;

if (args.length === 1) {
  console.log('Try to pass some arguments when invoking this script!');
} else {
  args.forEach(function(arg, i) {
    console.log(i + ': ' + arg);
  });
}
```
