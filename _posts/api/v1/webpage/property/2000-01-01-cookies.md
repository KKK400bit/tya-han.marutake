Get or set Cookies visible to the current URL (though, for setting, use of `page.addCookie` is preferred). This array will be pre-populated by any existing Cookie data visible to this URL that is stored in the CookieJar, if any.

Cookies is an array of objects: 
```javascript
{ 
  domain: 'example.com',
  expires: 'Sat Oct 11 2014 21:44:33 GMT+0200 (CEST)',
  expiry: 1476128618,
  httponly: false,
  name: 'cookieName',
  path: '/',
  secure: false,
  value: cookieValue
}
```

## Examples

```javascript
var webPage = require('webpage');
var page = webPage.create();
// @TODO: Finish page.cookies example.
```
