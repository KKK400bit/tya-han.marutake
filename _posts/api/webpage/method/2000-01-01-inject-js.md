`injectJs(filename)` {boolean}

Injects external script code from the specified file into the page (like `page.includeJs`, except that the file does not need to be accessible from the hosted page).

If the file cannot be found in the current directory, `libraryPath` is used for additional look up.

This function returns `true` if injection is successful, otherwise it returns `false`.

## Examples

```javascript
var webPage = require('webpage');
var page = webPage.create();
// @TODO: Finish page.injectJs example.
```
