**Note** Binary packages are made available on a volunteer basis. There is no need to
ask when a binary package for a given platform will be ready. The packagers are fully aware of every source release and they give their best effort to make the binaries available.

Download service is kindly provided by [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads). Previous releases download was provided by [Google Code Project Hosting](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/downloads/).

## Windows

Download [phantomjs-1.9.7-windows.zip](https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads/phantomjs-1.9.7-windows.zip) (6.7 MB) and extract (unzip) the content.

The executable `phantomjs.exe` is ready to use.

**Note**: For this static build, the binary is self-contained with no external dependency. It will run on a fresh install of Windows XP or later versions. There is no requirement to install Qt, WebKit, or any other libraries.

## Mac OS X

Download [phantomjs-1.9.7-macosx.zip](https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads/phantomjs-1.9.7-macosx.zip) (9.0 MB) and extract (unzip) the content.

The binary `bin/phantomjs` is ready to use.

**Note**: For this static build, the binary is self-contained with no external dependency. It will run on a fresh install of Snow Leopard or later versions. There is no requirement to install Qt or any other libraries.

**Alternative** installation using Homebrew:

<pre>brew update &amp;&amp; brew install phantomjs</pre>

**Alternative** installation using MacPorts:

<pre>sudo port selfupdate &amp;&amp; sudo port install phantomjs</pre>

## Linux

For 64-bit system, download [phantomjs-1.9.7-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2](https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads/phantomjs-1.9.7-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2) (12.6 MB).

For 32-bit system, download [phantomjs-1.9.7-linux-i686.tar.bz2](https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads/phantomjs-1.9.7-linux-i686.tar.bz2) (12.9 MB).

This package is built on CentOS 5.8. It should run successfully on Lucid or more modern systems (including other distributions). There is no requirement to install Qt, WebKit, or any other libraries. It is however expected that some base libraries necessary for rendering ([FreeType](http://www.freetype.org/), [Fontconfig](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig)) and the basic font files are available in the system.

To install the dependencies on Red Hat based systems:
<pre>sudo yum install fontconfig freetype libfreetype.so.6 libfontconfig.so.1 libstdc++.so.6</pre>

Alternatively (for Unix-like systems), install the distribution-specific package using the native package manager (`apt-get` for Ubuntu and Debian, `pacman` for Arch Linux, `pkg_add` for OpenBSD, etc). **Warning**: The distribution-specific package may not always be on the latest stable version.

For older systems, please compile PhantomJS from source (see below).
