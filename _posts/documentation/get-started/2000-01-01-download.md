**Note** Binary packages are made available on a volunteer basis. There is no need to
ask when a binary package for a given platform will be ready. The packagers are fully aware of every source release and they give their best effort to make the binaries available.

Download service is kindly provided by [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads). Previous releases download was provided by [Google Code Project Hosting](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/downloads/).

## Windows

Download [phantomjs-2.0.0-windows.zip](https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads/phantomjs-2.0.0-windows.zip) (19.4 MB) and extract (unzip) the content.

The executable `phantomjs.exe` is ready to use.

**Note**: For this static build, the binary is self-contained with no external dependency. It will run on a fresh install of Windows Vista or later versions. There is no requirement to install Qt, WebKit, or any other libraries.

## Mac OS X

Download [phantomjs-2.0.0-macosx.zip](https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads/phantomjs-2.0.0-macosx.zip) (13.7 MB) and extract (unzip) the content. Then move the phantomjs bin to /usr/bin: `sudo mv bin/phantomjs /usr/bin/`

**Note**: For this static build, the binary is self-contained with no external dependency. It will run on a fresh install of OS X 10.7 (Lion) or later versions. There is no requirement to install Qt or any other libraries.

**Known Issue**: If launching the executable fails with the error `Killed: 9`, please decompress the binary first with [upx](http://upx.sourceforge.net/): `upx -d bin/phantomjs`.

## Linux

Binary packages for Linux are still being prepared. There are still issues to be solved until a static build is available (see [issue 12948](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/12948) for more details).

In the mean time, it is recommended that you build the Linux version from source.

## FreeBSD

Binary packages are available via pkg:

`$ sudo pkg install phantomjs`

You can also build PhantomJS yourself from the FreeBSD Ports Collection: [https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/lang/phantomjs/](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/lang/phantomjs/)

## Source Code

Download [phantomjs-2.0.0-source.zip](https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads/phantomjs-2.0.0-source.zip) (105 MB) and follow the [build instructions]({{ site.url }}/build.html).
